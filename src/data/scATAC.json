      "description": "Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement is a major oncogenic driver in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). While ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown promising therapeutic effects, overcoming resistance with immunotherapy becomes necessary when resistance develops. However, various clinical trials have revealed that their efficacies remain limited. To investigate the tumor microenvironment (TME) factors contributing to poor immune checkpoint blockade responses in ALK-positive patients, we performed single-cell RNA and ATAC sequencing on lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) tumors with and without ALK rearrangements. Integrative analysis with additional public LUAD cohorts revealed distinct immune landscapes in ALK-positive tumors, marked by enriched innate immunity and depleted adaptive immunity. ALK-positive malignant cells exhibit higher stemness and aggressive phenotype. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in these tumors predominantly maintain pro-tumoral M2-like states, reinforcing immune suppression. B cells show reduced immune reactivity and impaired tertiary lymphoid structure formation, while CD8+ T cells display bystander-like signatures and reduced tumor reactivity. Single-cell chromatin accessibility profiles combined with regulatory network analysis suggest that differences in transcription factor activities, rather than chromatin accessibility, may underlie T cell dysfunction. These findings provide insights into the immunosuppressive TME of ALK-positive LUAD, potentially explaining the failure of recent immunotherapy trials and highlighting targets for improving efficacy."

We characterized regulatory regions with active (H3K4me1 and H3K27ac, two replicates) epigenetic marks in Naive and instructed ESC. To gain insite on how chromatin accessibility remodelled and the transcriptionally heterogeneity of differntiated ESCs, we performed scATAC-seq and scRNAseq in ES-derived aPSM (aPSM) and multiomics in ES-derived HIFLR (HIFLR) . We then leveraged these datasets and, by combining chromatin accessibility, in situ Hi-C chromatin conformation in aPSM and HIFLR cells, genome editing, and reporter assays have identified regulatory regions directing initial Pax7 expression and activation of the myogenic and neurogenic programs."
